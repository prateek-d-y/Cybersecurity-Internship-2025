## Recommended learning path (sequence)

1. **Foundations**

   * Introduction to HTTP, parameters (query, body, headers, cookies)
   * Using Burp Proxy and basic intercepting
   * Repeater & Intruder basics
2. **Input-based vulnerabilities**

   * Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) — reflected, stored, DOM
   * SQL injection (boolean, time-based, error-based)
3. **Server-side and auth logic**

   * Path traversal / File read
   * Insecure direct object references (IDOR)
   * Broken access control & authorization bypass
4. **Advanced injection & deserialization**

   * Command injection, OS injection
   * XXE, XML/JSON issues, insecure deserialization
5. **Modern web topics**

   * CSRF, SSRF, JWT issues
   * File upload protections and bypasses
   * Web application logic flaws / multi-step workflows
6. **Automation & exploitation**

   * Burp extensions & macros
   * Writing custom payload lists and scanners

---

## Lab categories (quick jump targets)

* **Cross-site scripting (XSS)**
* **SQL injection**
* **Server-side request forgery (SSRF)**
* **XML external entity (XXE)**
* **Path traversal / File inclusion**
* **Authentication and session management**
* **Access control / IDOR**
* **Insecure file upload**
* **Command injection**
* **Business logic vulnerabilities**

> Use the `All labs` page on the Academy to filter by category and difficulty.

## Useful Burp Suite docs & tools

* **Burp Suite documentation & user guide** — sections on Proxy, Repeater, Intruder, Sequencer, Scanner
* **Burp extensions (BApp Store)** — discover useful extensions for automation and payload generation
* **Burp Collaborator** — for out-of-band vulnerabilities like blind SSRF or blind XXE

---

## Suggested PortSwigger labs to practice (by skill level)

### Beginner

* Labs that teach basic intercepting with Burp Proxy
* Simple reflected XSS labs
* Basic SQL injection (error/union-free) labs

### Intermediate

* Stored XSS with filters
* Auth bypass & session fixation labs
* Path traversal + local file read labs
* Insecure file upload (bypass content-type and extension checks)

### Advanced

* Blind SQL injection (time-based)
* SSRF leading to internal network scanning
* XXE to exfiltrate files or trigger SSRF
* Chained logic vulnerabilities (multi-step business logic bypasses)

---

## Quick tips for lab workflow

* Always start by **enumerating parameters** (GET/POST body, JSON, headers, cookies).
* Use Burp **Repeater** to prototype payloads quickly.
* Use **history** & **search** in Burp to find interesting requests.
* For blind vulns, use **Burp Collaborator** or time-based techniques.
* Keep a small, organized payload wordlist for each class of vuln (XSS, SQLi, file traversal).
* Read the lab description carefully — sometimes the intended vulnerability is hinted.

---

## Notes for report-writing (PortSwigger labs)

* Save the vulnerable request, the exploited request, and the exact payload used.
* Mention the root cause + remediation suggestion (e.g., `validate input`, `use prepared statements`, `sanitize output`, `apply proper access controls`).
* Add screenshots (leave space in your report for PoC images).
* If applicable, mention whether the issue is **authenticated** or **requires multi-step** actions.

## Markdown checklist you can reuse when doing a lab

* [ ] Lab title & URL
* [ ] Difficulty
* [ ] Description / Objective
* [ ] Steps taken (enumeration) - include requests & payloads
* [ ] PoC (request+response, screenshot)
* [ ] Root cause analysis
* [ ] Fix / remediation
* [ ] Notes & references

---

## Extras — bookmarks to keep

* `All labs` filtered by category (use academy search filters)
* `Search` on the Academy for keywords like: "time-based", "filter bypass", "file upload"
* PortSwigger blog posts for deep dives on vulnerabilities and bypass techniques

---

## If you want, I can:

* Generate a printable Word/PDF lab report template that follows the checklist above.
* Create a prioritized study list for the next 2 weeks tailored to your current level.
