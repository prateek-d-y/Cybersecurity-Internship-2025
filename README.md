## 📅 Weekly Breakdown

### 🔹 Week 1 — MITRE TTP Mapping
- Map APT tactics, techniques, and procedures to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.  
- Create and test YARA rules.  
- Export IOCs to MISP and document processes with screenshots.

### 🔹 Week 2 — Malware & IOC (APT28)
- Study APT28 threat actor and campaign artifacts.  
- Extract and validate Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).  
- Correlate findings using MISP & Hybrid Analysis.

### 🔹 Week 3 — Linux Privilege Escalation
- Solve OverTheWire: Bandit challenges for fundamentals.  
- Build a local privesc cheat sheet and document privilege escalation vectors.

### 🔹 Week 4 — OSINT & Reconnaissance
- Analyze email metadata and image provenance.  
- Perform passive recon using OSINT tools and document findings.

### 🔹 Week 5 — Web Exploitation
- Identify and document XSS, SQLi, and SSRF vulnerabilities.  
- Use Burp Suite for request/response analysis and logging (see `PortSwigger-Links.md`).

### 🔹 Week 6 — Vulnerable Virtual Machines
- Target VMs such as Mr. Robot and DC-1 for full exploitation chains.  
- Produce step-by-step root access walkthroughs with screenshots.

### 🔹 Week 7 — Log Analysis & Incident Response
- Perform threat hunting using Graylog queries.  
- Reconstruct attack timelines and draft an incident response checklist.

### 🔹 Week 8 — Finalization
- Compile weekly deliverables into a final internship report (PDF).  
- Peer review and finalize GitHub submission.
